            Fewer people could've led a more quiet, secluded life than Gail, but the media always seemed to find her through her "sets" on Polyvore. 
          </p>
          <p class="page-intro-text">The two most notable media giants that featured Gail were <em>The New Yorker</em> magazine and <em>Glamour</em> magazine.</p>

            <h2 class="magazine_title">Glamour</h2>
            <p>In December of 2010, <em>Glamour</em> ran a short web-only feature on Gail entitled </p>
            <p><em><a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/daily-outfit-idea-a-sexy-last-" target="_blank">Daily Outfit Idea: A Sexy Last-Minute New Year's Eve Party Look</a></em></p>
            <p>Here's an outake of that article:</p>

            <h2 class="magazine_title">The New Yorker</h2>
            <p>In March of 2010, Polyvore, a social media startup company (now defunct), flew Gail to San Francisco for an interview to fill an opening in their marketing department. Gail was a major contributor of fashion "sets" on Polyvore's social media website, and had received the invitation to interview for the position after stricking up friendships with several of the company's marketing executives while attending fashion week junkets as Polyvore's guest. </p>
              
            <p>Coincidentally, during Gail's interview visit to Polyvore's corporate headquarters, a reporter from <em>The New Yorker</em> magazine was also there gathering info for a feature article on the Polyvore company. There had been no intention to interview Gail, but upon meeting her, writer Alexandra Jacobs, found Gail to be personable and interesting enough to work her into her story for the March 29 print edition of The New Yorker.</p>
