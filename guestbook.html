            <p>Gail was a colleague, friend and mentor to me. She was always there whenever I needed a chat, rant – whatever. We had a mutual love of flowers, and she convinced me to add peonies to my garden. Now every spring they come up, I will think of her. In fact, that’s always how I think of her, surrounded by flowers. She (and Betty) would always give me a video tour of whatever was coming up in her garden when we chatted through the years.</p>

            <p>To say I miss her is an understatement. Her sense of humor and quick wit is what I miss most, but also her ability to just be there for someone and give direct, honest advice. She was a great friend and a gem of a human being. She was a beautiful, inside and out and I hope she found peace after everything she’s been through this past year.</p>

            <p>I asked her advice on shoes once, asking if I could get her fashion advice and helped me find the perfect pair of rubber boots to wear around our farm (she laughed as she knew I couldn’t have meant heels). She must have shopped through every single online store she could think of. She found me the absolute BEST pair, they have little bees all over them. I wear them still, and think of her. That’s who she was, going to the ends of the earth – above and beyond to help someone. She once spent hours walking me through preparation of Betty’s food when I had a question about changing my own dog’s food, as she walked me through the (very lengthy) process, I thought “who has time to do this every week?”. Gail did, she found the time to do things 110%. Oh beautiful Betty, we both agreed – she’s worth it.</p>

            <p>I will miss her tremendously. She had a massive impact on my life – both work and personal.</p>

            <p>I have many favourite Gail stories and memories it is hard to sum up into one.  Overall though Gail and I could not be more different.  She was stylish and a fashion influencer, I am a mom of two who wears flats.  But for some reason we were the right and left hand of each other.</p>  
            
            <p>I loved how she would always tell you where things were at, the truth you always knew but needed someone to say.  I loved her creativity, her story telling and the great recipes she would be planning from the New Yorker Magazine.</p>  
            
            <p>The passion she took in her garden, her house, her dog, her style.  We always said we were each other’s sister in a previous life and the fact we were both Swedish didn’t hurt reinforcing that.</p>

            <p>Rest peacefully my friend. I am sad that we lost touch over the years, but I am forever grateful for our extremely close friendship during our teenage years. You will be forever beautiful & always in my heart. Fly high with the angels.
