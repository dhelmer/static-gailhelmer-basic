            <p>Gail was insightful and curious, and was known for her dedication to her marketing career, as well as her passion for  fashion, gardening, watercolour painting, and calligraphy.</p>

            <p class="title-emphasis">In her own words ...</p>

            <p>I never imagined this was my destiny, this happens to other people. Accepting it though has been a journey of reflection, and thinking about what really matters, and how close did I get to living my truest, most authentic self. I leave knowing I did my best and that I am grateful for all the abundance.</p> 

            <p>Yes, I will miss all the big moments, the little moments, and most particularly of all, those beautiful unplanned perfect moments&mdash;those were always my favorite.</p>

            <p>Three years of challenges, but as I look back at each month, there were so many positive experiences too. I had time to appreciate the simple things, plus learn all things I had always wanted to: calligraphy, watercolor painting, and French.  I was able to connect with family and friends one last time, often in my beloved garden with a glass of wine.</p>
            
            <p>And greatest of all, I found the peace to accept a situation I had no control over. It is a luxury to get to say goodbye to life.&nbsp;</p>

            <p class="author">&mdash;Gail Helmer, April 12th, 2021.</p>
